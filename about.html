I'm a software devoloper and co-founder of a Munich based [startup]. During the day I mostly use C++
and Ruby. After work it's mainly haskell ;)

This site has been made using the following tools/technologies:


* <del>haskell</del> ruby and the awesome <del>[hakyll]</del> [jekyll] framework[^1]
* markdown and [pandoc] for rendering the html
* Ruby for all scripting done during website creation
* vim for editing my posts
* [sass] -- css with superpowers
* git for version controll and deployment
* linode for hosting the site
* nginx for serving the static content

Full source code is available [on github].
